## 🛰️ Starship Structure  
This project is split into two main parts: Frontend (UI and components) and Backend (Marvin Bot server). Here’s how the folders are structured:
```plain-text
  project-name/
  ├── frontend/  
  │   ├── components/  
  │   ├── Pages/  
  │   ├── ...  
  ├── backend/  
  │   ├── marvin-bot-server/  
  │   ├── ...  
  └── README.md
```
frontend/: Contains all the user interface components and React-based code for displaying the portfolio and interacting with the user.
backend/: Houses the server-side code that handles the Marvin bot and manages server calls.


## 🌌 How to Get This Spaceship Running  
Wanna see the magic in action locally? Here’s how:  

1. Clone the repository:

  ```bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
  ```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory to work on the UI:

  ```bash
    cd frontend
  ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

  ```bash
    npm install
  ```

4. Start the frontend development server:

  ```bash
    npm start
  ```

5. In a separate terminal, navigate to the backend directory to work on the Marvin bot server:

  ```bash
    cd backend
  ```

6. Install backend dependencies:

  ```bash
    npm install
  ```

7. Start the backend development server:

  ```bash
    npm start
  ```
 
Now you’ll have both the frontend and backend running locally! 🎉
